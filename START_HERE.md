# 🎯 NEXT STEPS - Getting Your App Running

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get MongoDB Running

**Option A: Local MongoDB**
```powershell
# If MongoDB is installed as a service (check with):
Get-Service -Name MongoDB

# If not running, start it:
Start-Service MongoDB

# Or if you installed MongoDB manually:
mongod
```

**Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Recommended)**
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. Create a free account
3. Create a free cluster (M0 Sandbox)
4. Click "Connect" → "Connect your application"
5. Copy the connection string
6. Replace `<password>` with your actual password
7. Replace `myFirstDatabase` with `ai-project-management`

### Step 2: Get Gemini API Key

1. Visit https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key (it looks like: `AIzaSy...`)

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Open `server/.env` file and update:

```env
# Replace with your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai-project-management
# Or if using Atlas:
# MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ai-project-management?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Keep port as 5000
PORT=5000

# Paste your Gemini API key here
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy_your_actual_key_here

# Keep as development
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Save the file!**

### Step 4: Start Backend

Open a **NEW PowerShell terminal** and run:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Abhishek\AIproject\server
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
✅ MongoDB Connected: localhost
📊 Database: ai-project-management
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```

**Keep this terminal open!**

### Step 5: Start Frontend

Open a **SECOND PowerShell terminal** and run:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Abhishek\AIproject\client
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE ready in XXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

**Keep this terminal open too!**

### Step 6: Open Your Browser

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:5173
3. You should see the beautiful AI Project Manager dashboard! 🎉
